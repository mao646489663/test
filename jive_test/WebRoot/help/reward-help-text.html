<p>
Reward points are a virtual currency users can use to encourage others to answer their
questions. Topic authors can decide to assign a certain number of points to their question and
then reward the best answer (or answers) with all (or some) of the points. Simple calculations
are then done to compute the topic users (by reward point) in certain categories or overall.
Reward point summaries are displayed in each user's profile page.

<br>
<p>
The author of a discussion topic can assign points to their question as an incentive for other
members to respond. The author can choose to award the best responses to that question with
all of the points or some. The points can be awarded all to a single user's response or partially
awarded to several users' responses. Points awarded in the discussion topic are deducted from the
points the author assigned to the topic. In addition, there are a few other rules:
<ul>
    <li>Topic authors cannot assign points to themselves.
    <li>Users can remove the points assigned as long as there haven't been any replies to their
        question. This might be necessary if the author assigned the points in error.
    <li>Users can assign points to a question at a later time to encourage others to answer.
</ul>
