<a name="discussion"></a>What are discussion forums?
</span>
<br>
Discussion forums allow you to share ideas, opinions and
information quickly and easily. Organized by topics in an
easy-to-follow format, discussion forums are designed so you can
quickly locate information, find other knowledgeable users and
participate in conversations.

<br>
The content in Jive Forums is structured as follows:<br>
<ul>

<em>Forum Categories:</em> Categories represent a collection of
forums as well as other categories. Often, categories are used
to organize forums into a tree structure so members can find
the right discussions more easily.
</li>
<li>
<em>Forums:</em> Forums are the areas where individual
discussions take place as a listing of topics.
</li>
<li>
<em>Topics:</em> Topics (also known as "threads") are the
discussions that consist of one or more messages displayed as a
list, or in a tree structure of messages and their replies.
</li>
<li>
<em>Messages:</em> Messages are the individual discussion posts
made by community members.
</li>
<li>
<em>Replies:</em> Message replies are posts in response to
other messages and are organized in a flat or threaded mode.

<a name="watches"></a>What are watches?</a>

 A watch notifies you if the topic you are interested in
has been updated. Notifications may be sent through the web or
e-mail.
</p>

<p>
To add a topic to your watch list, click on the Watch This
Topic link at the top of the topic page. Click on

notifications. After 30 days, inactive watches automatically
expire.

"Your Control Panel" then "Watches". From this screen you can choose to
receive email notifications when new posts are made. Just click on

</span>
<br>
To format your message text, there are three buttons
for Bold, Italics and
Underline. Clicking on these buttons will add tags
to the message field.
</p>

<p>
For example, typing: "This is [b]bold[/b] text, and this is
[i]italicized[/i] text" will appear as "<b>This is
bold text</b>, and this is <em>italicized</em> text"
once you post the message. 
</p>

<p>
<span class="jive-faq-answer">
<a name="spellcheck"></a>How do I check the spelling of my message?
</span>
<br>
To check the text of your message for proper
spelling, just click Spell Check on the
post screen.
</p>

<p>
If our spell check dictionary doesn't recognize a word in your
message, it will appear in a box. You can correct it yourself by
simply typing over what is displayed. If the dictionary has any
suggestions, you will be able to see them in the suggestion box.
</p>

<p>
To choose one of the suggestions, simply select the suggestion
you'd like to use and click on the Change button
for each of the words you would like changed.
</p>

<p>
When you are finished checking your entire message, click on Post Message to 
save your changes and post the message with your spelling corrections. If you 
want to continue editing your message, hit Go Back or Edit to return to the post 
message area.
