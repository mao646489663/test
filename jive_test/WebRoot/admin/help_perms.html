<b>Permissions Summary</b>

<ul>
    <p>
    The summary page displays an overview of permissions currently set and allows you to
    update and remove permissions for user types (guests, registered users), users and groups.
    </p>
    <p>
    To grant a new permission, click on the "Grant New Permission" tab. If you just want to update
    permissions, use the main summary page. Click on the additional permission you want to grant
    and click "Save Changes." To remove a permission, click on the delete icon in the row
    associated with a user type, user or group.
    </p>
    <p>
    Note, it is not possible to completely remove the "Anyone" or "Registered Users" types rows.
    To remove all permissions for these types, click on the remove icon. To grant new permissions
    for these types, click on the desired permissions and click "Save Changes."

<b>Grant Permissions To</b>

<ul>
    <p>
    Permissions can be granted to users or groups, or two special classes of users:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>"Anybody" (Guests)</b>

            <p>
            Anybody visiting the site matches the "guest" permission, including
            users that haven't logged-in.
            </p>

        <li><b>"Registered Users"</b>

            <p>
            "Registered Users" are anybody that has a user account and is
            logged in. One common permission setup is to allow creation of
            threads and messages by registered users, and read
            permissions for guests.
            </p>

        <li><b>User</b>

            <p>
            A permission for a particular user. Enter the user's name.
            </p>

        <li><b>Group</b>

            <p>
            A permission for a particular group. Enter the group's name.
            </p>

    </ul>
</ul>

<b>Admin Permissions</b>
<ul>
    <p>
    Administrative permissions in Jive Forums define a distinct set of roles
    that can be used to divide administrative duties. <i>Note: only Jive Forums
    Professional and Enterprise support role-based administration. Jive Forums
    Lite only allows a single system administrator</i>.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>"System Admin"</b>

            <p>
            System administrators have complete control of the system. They
            are the only role permitted to use panels on the Global Settings
            tab.
            </p>

        <li><b>"Category Admin"</b>

            <p>
            Category administrators can create and delete sub-categories and
            forums inside the category they are admins for. Additionally, they
            have the same abilities as forum administrators for all forums
            in the category and sub-categories.
            </p>

        <li><b>"Forum Admin"</b>

            <p>
            A forum administrator controls all settings for the forum and
            manages the forum's content.
            </p>

        <li><b>"Moderator"</b>

            <p>
            Moderators have the ability to manage content in the forums for which
            they are a moderator. Additionally, if "moderation" is turned on,
            they have the ability to reject or accept threads and messages.
            </p>
    </ul>
</ul>
