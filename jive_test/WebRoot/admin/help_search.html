<b><a name="search_status" style="text-decoration:none;"
 ></a>Search Status</b>
<ul>
    Indicates whether searching is disabled or enabled. When searching is
    disabled, auto-indexing will not occur, and users will not see the option
    to make searches in the default skin.

<ul>
    <p>
    Jive Forums uses <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene" target="_blank">
    Lucene</a> to power its search feature. An index of all forum content is stored on
    the filesystem in a format that is optimized for fast querying. The index
    is automatically updated with the latest content on a
    periodic basis when auto-indexing is enabled. Messages will not appear
    in search results until they are added to the index, so choose an indexing
    interval that is appropriate for the pace of your community.
    </p>

    <p>
    Specific settings:
    <ul>
        <li><u>Automatically index forum content</u> - toggles automatic index
            updating. The search index will be updated based on the index
            update time. When an index update is run, any new content posted since the last
            run will be added to the search index.
        <li><u>Index update time</u> - The time interval (in minutes) between
            automatic search index updates.
        <li><u>Indexer Type</u> - This indicates how forum content is parsed and placed
            in the index. Specific indexers are available for a number of languages and most
            support stemming. Stemming is a way to index the data such that a search for
            "talk" matches "talk", "talking" and "talked".
        <li><u>Allow wildcards in search queries</u> - Indicates whether or not search queries
            can contain
            <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/queryparsersyntax.html" target="_blank"
             >Lucene wildcards</a>
            which are special commands for the search query parser.
        <li><u>Group search results by thread</u> - Indicates if multiple search results from the
            same topic will be grouped. If there are multiple search results within a topic,
            the most relevant result will be returned as a representative of the topic.
    </ul>
    </p>
</ul>

<b><a name="update_index" style="text-decoration:none;"
 ></a>Update Index</b>
<ul>
    Initiate an index update, which will add all new content to the search index
    since the last index update.
</ul>

<b><a name="rebuild_index" style="text-decoration:none;"
 ></a>Rebuild Index</b>
<ul>
    Initiate a full index rebuild, which will create an entirely new index
    with all data. Index rebuilds can take considerably longer than index
    updates. Rebuilds are generally only required if the search index becomes
    corrupted (for example, if the application server shuts down while an index
    update is occuring).
</ul>

<b><a name="optimize_index" style="text-decoration:none;"
 ></a>Optimize Index</b>
<ul>
    If you have a large set data and don't want to do a full rebuild of your
    search index, it's recommended to optimize the index. This will make
    search queries run more efficiently.
</ul>
